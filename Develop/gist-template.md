# Matching email Regex Tutorial

Welcome to our Regex tutorial, where we'll delve into the powerful world of regular expressions and how they can be used to efficiently match and validate email addresses. Regular expressions, commonly referred to as regex, provide a versatile and concise way to search for patterns within text. Whether you're a developer, data analyst, or just curious about the intricacies of pattern matching, understanding how to create regex patterns for email matching will prove to be an invaluable skill. In this tutorial, we'll guide you step by step through the process of constructing regex patterns that accurately identify and validate email addresses, ensuring your applications handle email-related tasks with precision. Let's get started!


## Summary

This tutorial will be explain the following Regex expression

Matching an Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/

Email matching using regular expressions (regex) involves creating a pattern that can accurately identify and validate email addresses within a given text. This pattern helps ensure that the provided email addresses adhere to the standard format and are correctly structured. The regex pattern considers elements such as the username, domain name, and top-level domain (TLD) while accommodating special characters and variations that are valid in email addresses. By mastering email matching regex, you can enhance your ability to efficiently process and validate email inputs in various applications, ensuring the accuracy and integrity of email-related tasks.

<a name="`^` and `$`"></a>
- `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`
<a name="`([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`"></a>
- `@`
<a name="`@`"></a>
- `([\da-z\.-]+)`

- `\.`
<a name="`\.`"></a>
- `([a-z\.]{2,6})`
<a name="`([a-z\.]{2,6})`"></a>



## `^` and `$`
These symbols denote the start and end of the string, ensuring that the entire string is matched and not just a part of it.

### `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`
This captures the username part of the email address. It matches one or more lowercase letters, digits, underscores, periods, or hyphens. The parentheses () indicate a capturing group, which is used to extract the matched content.

### `@`
 This is a literal "@" symbol, which separates the username from the domain name.

### `([\da-z\.-]+)`
This captures the domain name part of the email address. It matches one or more digits (\d), lowercase letters, periods, or hyphens. Again, the parentheses define a capturing group.

### `\.`
 This is an escaped period, matching a literal period character to separate the domain name from the TLD.

###  `([a-z\.]{2,6})`
This captures the top-level domain (TLD) part of the email address. It matches between 2 and 6 lowercase letters or periods, accommodating common TLDs.
